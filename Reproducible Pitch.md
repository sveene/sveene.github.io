Why is the ShinyApp - Basic Introduction to ggplot2 needed?
========================================================

- Non-intuitive syntax of `ggplot` R commands
- Basic capabilities of `ggplot` not widely known
- Options such as `colour` and `facet_wrap` mysterious to many

Who needs this ShinyApp?
========================================================

- Anyone who wants to start using `ggplot` but was hesitant to make the leap
- Anyone teaching others how to use `ggplot` who needs a handy interactive example
- Anyone interested to see power and flexibility of `ggplot`
- Anyone wishing to observe power of the `eval` command

```{r}
ggplot_command = sprintf("g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=%s, y=%s, colour=%s)) + facet_wrap(~%s) + geom_%s()",
                             input$x, input$y, input$colour, input$facet_wrap, input$geom)
    eval(parse(text=ggplot_command))
```
Example Command and Plot Generated by the ShinyApp - Basic Introduction to ggplot2
========================================================

```r
g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy, colour=class)) + facet_wrap(~drv) + geom_point()
```
